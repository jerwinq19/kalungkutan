        <span>Fade. Drift. Silence.</span>
        <p>We build walls, only to tear them down, thinking we can start again. We grow, but with each step forward, something is lost. The search is endless, with no answers—only the quiet echo of questions left behind. In the end, what remains? Only the ruins of what we once hoped for, fading into silence.</p>

            <p>A female mime stands in the pale light, her painted face streaked with silent tears. The stark black and white of her makeup can’t hide the raw emotion in her eyes, each tear sliding down like words unsaid. Her gloved hands hover in the air, trapped in an invisible box, a prison of her own making. Silent, yet her sorrow is deafening, echoing in the emptiness around her as she stands alone, a broken performer in a world that no longer watches.</p>

            <p>A man slouches in the dim light, hidden behind a bunny helmet, smoke drifting from the cigarette clutched between weary fingers. The helmet's drooping ears and his hollow gaze speak of silent struggles, as he stands alone, lost in a world that no longer feels like his own..</p>

            <p>A man holds a brightly colored toy gun to his temple, his lips twisted into a wild, unsettling laugh. The absurdity of the moment contrasts sharply with the darkness in his eyes, a mask of humor barely hiding the chaos within. His laughter echoes through the empty space, hollow and forced, as if mocking the weight of his own thoughts. The toy, harmless in its appearance, becomes a symbol of something much heavier—a joke no one else is laughing at..</p>

            <h2>Homebound Burden</h2>
            <p>
                A man stands with a small, crumbling house perched awkwardly on his head, its broken windows reflecting his hollow gaze. The weight of it pulls his shoulders down, as if the burden of carrying a home that no longer feels like one has left him exhausted and lost. Sadness clings to him, heavy and silent, like the dust settling on forgotten places.

            <h2>Eyes That See Too Much</h2>
            <p>
                A woman with a vacant stare stands, her chest painted with large, surreal eyes that seem to watch the world while she remains emotionally distant. The curly white wig and her hands on her hips add to the unsettling contrast between performance and detachment, as though she's both seen and unseen, trapped in her own quiet frustration.</p>
